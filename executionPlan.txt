key lookup
clustered index scan
index seek
right to left, top to bottom

Query Tuning:

SARGability

--Index scan vs Index seek 
--where clause - use it properly with no logical changes(avoid the use of functions)

SeekNotHappening

MultiColumn Indexes - seek works only if we go from left column to right one

redundant indexes - will result in worse case scenario

the indexes need to be created very carefully

ensure that the seeking capability is not lost with wildcard charactor at starting etc.

Implicit Conversions:

unicode instead of original datatype of varchar - cpu is utilized in planning the conversion

instead, use explicit conversion - tell sql server what exactly to do - helpful
