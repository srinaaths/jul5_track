Implementation:

mechanism to indicate which transactions have finished - or by keeping a copy of the data before any changes occurred.

Journaling

Some form of logging/ Journaling to track the changes

system syncs the logs as necessary after changes have taken place

most common implementation of acid properties done via locks

data is locked until a transaction completes or fails, to guarantee acid

for durability, databases implement write-ahead logs

How concurrency is possible in db:

Isolation Transaction Level:

T1 & T2 - isolated from each other

various isolation levels are defined in sql

Violations:

Dirty Read,
Nonrepeatable Read,
Phantom

Dirty Read
T1 - writes (but not commited)
T2 - reads

Nonrepeatable Read:

T1 - reads the value of A
T2 - writes the value of A
T1 - reads again - finds that value has been changed

reading cannot be repeated in this case

Phantom:
T1 (Q1(c))
for the same query, some extra row is being read

4 isolation levels:
read uncommitted
read committed
repeatable read
serializable

concurrency control protocol

while T1 is performing write operation, T2 should not be allowed access

basically, we lock the access of that database item
