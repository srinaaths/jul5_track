3 main steps of retrieving the data from the database

SQL command - Parser and Translator - Relational algebra expression - Optimizer (Also gives statistics of data) - Execution Plan - Evaluation Engine - Query Output

SQL is high level language - needs to be converted to a language understandable by the physical implementaion of the database

Parser & translator - functions
Optimization - functions - same query can be executed in different ways 
Execution Plan - Systematic step by step execution of primitive operations for fetching of data. Different evaluation queries for a particular query might have different query costs
